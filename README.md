# Auto GMail Creator

I need multiple google accounts for some projects. Web browser automation is out of the picture since it requires some QR shenanigans. I tried creating multiple google accounts before manually using an emulator so I'm trying to automate it so I can create multiple accounts while I'm asleep.

## Prerequisites
- Android Studio and its device manager
- Appium
- Appium Inspector 


## Try 
0. Run uv install
1. Run 'appium' command on Powershell
2. Run 'uv run main.py'

## UPDATE 01/19/2026
- This project has failed its purpose because SMS verification is apparently blocked while using an emulator. Will find a new way.
